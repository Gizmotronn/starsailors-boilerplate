# Star Sailors Boilerplate
Here you'll find the different scenes & assets that 
are seen in the trailers and will gradually be 
imported into the main codebase of Star Sailors.

The Signal-K/Unity-Demo repository is for all Unity 
snippets, while this is specifically for snippets 
that show off the game's scenes and/or functionality 
from an end-user perspective.

This repo is open-source and you can browse the issue 
list in this repo to find links to all the docs and 
important links/information.
